## Captain's Log Part 1

I decided to begin on the UI with a create react app. I started here because I enjoy having the visual structure of the front end before connecting to the back. Per instructions, I chose a UI component framework. I used material-UI. It's new to me but something I've intended to learn about so I decided to dive in. I relied heavily on examples in the documentation, adjusting them to suit the brief.
